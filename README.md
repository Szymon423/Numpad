## 📖 About

This project is about designing my own Numpad.

> [!NOTE]  
> But not as good as existing solutions

I wanted to do this because I bought a keyboard without a numeric keypad. The project was on my to-do list, waiting until (I make it real) I bought a keyboard with a numeric keypad. Even though I'm the proud owner of a keyboard with a numeric keypad, I wanted to finish it.

## 🔧 Hardware

Hardware was designed in **KiCad** around the **RP2040** from Raspberry Pi. I like low-profile keyboards, thus I used **Gateron KS-33** switches with custom keycaps inspired by the **Logitech MX Keys**.
